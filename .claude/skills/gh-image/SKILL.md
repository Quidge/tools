# GitHub Image Asset and Markdown Workflow

Use this repo-specific flow to publish an image and generate reusable GitHub-flavored markdown.

## Preconditions

- Ensure the image file exists before upload.
- Run from this repository so `uv run` can execute local scripts.

## Upload Image Asset

Run:

```sh
uv run scripts/upload-asset.py /absolute/or/relative/path/to/image.png
```

Example:
```sh
$ uv run scripts/upload-asset.py /absolute/or/relative/path/to/the_image_name.png
https://github.com/quidge/tools/releases/download/asset-dump/the_image_name+<uuid>.png
```

The generated UUID suffix is required because two release assets cannot share the same name.

## Build Markdown Snippet

If you're embedding this in GH flavored markdown, you can use a snippet like this with the uploaded asset url:

```md
![alt-text-for-screenshot](https://github.com/quidge/tools/releases/download/asset-dump/<filename>+<uuid>.png)
```

Use an alt text that describes what the image proves.

## Cleanup

**NO CLEANUP IS NECESSARY FOR THE ASSET**. Leaving many assets in the release is fine.
